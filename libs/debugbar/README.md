# wordpres-debug-bar
New Debug Bar for Wordpress, using the PHP Debug Bar framework.

Such as the [debug bar for Laravel](https://github.com/barryvdh/laravel-debugbar), this plugin integrates the PHP Debug Bar to display debug information in a nice toolbar on the bottom of the page.

Feel free to fork this project and add your own collectors. Or fix my bugs :)

I will not provide support for this plugin in any way. If you can code, you know how to use this. Remember:

![Its free software](https://camo.githubusercontent.com/df781f87da2f2db87b5cc3125d5459bc70812112/687474703a2f2f64726f70732e6b796c65666f782e63612f31637147502b "Its free software")

(Some code has been snatched from the Debug Bar plugin, but since that plugin hasn't been updated for over a year, I figured it would be alright :) If not, I'm sorry?)
